# We need to pin ppx_deriving_cmdliner because new packages are not uploaded to opam
# This template is a workaround suggested by:
# https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/pin-depends-in-dune/8066
# We may be able to remove this soon since pin-depends is going to be supported by dune:
# https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/9487
pin-depends: [
